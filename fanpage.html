    <h1>Thirty Only</h1>

    <p>
        "Thirty Only" tells the various crises and perplexities faced by three women at the age of thirty, 
        and records their resilience and growth fearlessly. 
        Gu Jia is the enviable upper level of the pyramid. She transformed her husband from a firework programmer to "General Xu", 
        and she also made herself a full-time wife of the top inside and outside. 
        However, when there was an intruder in this home, Gu Jia did not escape. Wang Manni is a maverick rebel, 
        convinced that she has both good looks and brains and is always worthy of better. 
        However, she also has her own worries. 
        Zhong Xiaoqin is the majority of the standardization. Married to the husband of a public institution, she has an ordinary job and can be an ordinary wife with peace of mind. 
        However, because of his writing hobby, he accidentally sold high-priced copyrights. 
        The economic and social status of the husband and wife was inverted overnight. 
        The marriage of strong women and weak men instantly lost balance, and Zhong Xiaoqin faced a choice.
